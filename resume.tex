    \begin{tightlist}
        \item Designed and implemented the \href{https://github.com/MiniTeks}{MiniTeks} (Minimal Tekton Server) along with unit tests, a training project that creates Tekton resources on Kubernetes/OpenShift clusters using the Tekton API. It was developed using Go, Kubernetes, Tekton, and Redis and had 3 parts: MKS Server, MKS CLI, and MKSDashboard.
        \item Contributed to Tekton Results as part of the Pipeline Service team. Tekton Results aims at long-term, efficient results storage of Tekton PipelineRuns and TaskRuns.

\section{Projects}
\combosection{\href{https://github.com/avinal/Profile-Readme-Wakatime}{Automated WakaTime GitHub Actions App}}{Python, Docker, GitHub Actions, Bash Scripting}{}{
  \begin{tightlist}
    \item Built an automated WakaTime coding statistics update system using Python scripts, shell scripts, Docker, the WakaTime API, and GitHub Actions. Currently, it has 42 stars on GitHub and 200+ active users worldwide. WakaTime is a utility to track coding activities across multiple IDEs and machines.
    \item This app generates a colorful bar graph of the coding activity tracked by WakaTime in the last week, daily at a specified time in SVG format. This image file can then be embedded into READMEs and websites. It can be scheduled to update more often or less often.
  \end{tightlist}
}

\combosection{\href{https://github.com/avinal/xeus-basic}{Xeus-BASIC}}{C, C++, Jupyter Notebook}{}{
